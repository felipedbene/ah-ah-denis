Here's a README.md file explaining the code and how to run it:

# Simple Web Game Server

This repository contains a simple HTML5 game exported from Godot Engine. The main file is `firstScriptProd.html`, which is actually an HTML file containing the game's web player.

## Contents

- `firstScriptProd.html`: The main HTML file containing the game's web player.
- `firstScriptProd.js`: JavaScript file for the game.
- `firstScriptProd.wasm`: WebAssembly file containing the game's core logic.
- `firstScriptProd.pck`: Godot game data package.
- `firstScriptProd.png`: Splash image for the game.
- `firstScriptProd.apple-touch-icon.png`: Icon for iOS devices.
- `firstScriptProd.icon.png`: Favicon for the web page.

## How to Run

To run this game locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory containing these files.

4. Run the following command:

   ```
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

5. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`

6. Click on the `firstScriptProd.html` file to start the game.

This command starts a simple HTTP server on port 8000, serving the files in the current directory.

## Notes

- The game uses WebAssembly, so it requires a modern web browser to run.
- If you encounter any issues with cross-origin isolation, you might need to set up proper CORS headers or use a more advanced server setup.
- This setup is intended for local testing and development. For production deployment, consider using a more robust web server.

```

This README provides a brief overview of the contents, explains how to run the server using the Python command, and includes some notes about potential issues and limitations. You can adjust it as needed based on any specific details about your game or additional setup requirements.
